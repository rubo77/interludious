- Parse dimensions, colors, and level layout identically

**Mapping**:
- `#` → Solid wall/barrier
- `*` → Restart point
- `@`-`K` → Sliders (12 types)
- `L`, `N` → Buttons
- `P`, `U`, `[`, `\` → Bunkers (4 types)
- `` ` `` → Fuel
- `d` → Power plant
- `m` → Pod position

### 2. Physics Engine (90% Reuse)
**Source**: `src/thrust.c`

Port these core physics functions to JavaScript:
- Ship movement (x, y, vx, vy with gravity)
- Thrust calculation (alpha, deltaalpha)
- Collision detection (insideblock, pixel-perfect)
- Pod towing physics (loadcontact, loadpoint)

**Constants to port** (from `thrust_t.h`):
- BBILDX, BBILDY (block dimensions)
- maxlenx, maxleny (max level size)
- Gravity constant

- `fragment` struct → Particle system
- Object types: FUEL, POWERPLANT, BUNKER1-4, BUTTON1-2

**Functions to port**:
- `newthing()`, `newslider()`, `newbullet()`
- `animatesliders()`, `movebullets()`, `movefragments()`
- `bunkerfirebullet()`, `hit()`, `explodething()`

### 4. Game Logic (80% Reuse)
**Source**: `src/thrust.c`, `src/level.c`

Port:
- Game state variables (score, lives, fuel, shield)
- Level progression logic
- Restart point system

## Level System Design

### Modular Level Format
Levels are stored as separate files with clear structure:

**Format Options:**
1. **Enhanced .def** (backward compatible with original)
   - Keep ASCII art layout
   - Add metadata section (name, author, difficulty, colors)
   - Add custom properties section

2. **JSON Format** (modern, extensible)
   - Structured data with validation
   - Easy to parse and modify
   - Support for custom properties

**Recommended:** Support both formats for maximum flexibility

### Level Structure
```
public/levels/
├── level1.def          # Original level 1
├── level2.def          # Original level 2
├── level3.def          # Original level 3
├── level4.def          # Original level 4
├── level5.def          # Original level 5
├── level6.def          # Original level 6
├── custom/
│   ├── my_level_1.def  # User-created level
│   ├── my_level_2.json # User-created level (JSON)
│   └── community/      # Community levels
└── templates/
    ├── easy_template.def
    ├── medium_template.def
    └── hard_template.def
```

### Level Metadata (Enhanced Format)
```def
# Metadata section
NAME: "Crystal Caves"
AUTHOR: "Player"
DIFFICULTY: 3
VERSION: 1.0
DESCRIPTION: "Navigate through crystal formations"

# Colors
BG_COLOR: 189 24 33
GUN_COLOR: 24 211 24
POD_COLOR: 24 211 24
TEXT_COLOR: 0 164 0
SHIELD_COLOR: 49 231 198

# Level dimensions
WIDTH: 82
HEIGHT: 60
START_HEIGHT: 17
EMPTY_HEIGHT: 5
BEDROCK_HEIGHT: 25

# Level layout (ASCII art)
...
```

### Level Validation
The level validator checks:
- Required fields present
- Valid dimensions (within min/max)
- Valid color values (0-255)
- Required elements (at least one restart point, one pod)
- Valid character codes in layout
- No overlapping objects
- Slider-button connections valid

### Level Editor Features
- **Visual Grid:** Click to place tiles
- **Tile Palette:** All available tiles (walls, bunkers, buttons, sliders, fuel, pod)
- **Undo/Redo:** Full history support
- **Preview Mode:** Test level without leaving editor
- **Export/Import:** Save as .def or JSON
- **Validation:** Real-time error checking
- **Templates:** Start from blank or existing templates
- **Community Sharing:** Export/import for sharing levels

## Asset Creation

### Modern Sprites
Create new high-resolution or vector-based assets:
- **Ship**: Modern design with 16 rotation angles, smooth edges, engine glow
- **Pod**: Sleek energy pod design with glow effects
- **Bunkers**: 4 types with modern sci-fi aesthetics
- **Bullets**: Smooth projectile designs with trail effects
- **Shield**: Transparent/glowing shield overlay
- **Walls**: Modern tileset with smooth edges, gradients, and textures
- **Particles**: Explosion, engine flame, spark effects with glow

**Tools**: Use vector graphics (SVG) or high-res PNG with transparency, optimize for Canvas rendering

### Sounds
Convert from `.snd` files:
- `engine.snd` → Engine thrust sound
- `blip.snd` → Pod pickup sound
- `boom.snd`, `boom2.snd` → Explosion sounds
- `zero.snd` → Shooting sound
- `harp.snd` → Background music (optional)

### Levels
Copy `.def` files unchanged:
- `level1.def` through `level6.def`

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Coordinate System
Keep the original 8-units-per-pixel system for physics accuracy, scale for rendering:
- Physics: Internal coordinates (8x precision)
- Rendering: Scale down by 8 for display

### 2. Game Loop
Use `requestAnimationFrame` with delta time for consistent physics:
```javascript
function gameLoop(timestamp) {
  const dt = timestamp - lastTime;
  updatePhysics(dt);
  render();
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

### 3. Collision Detection
Port the pixel-perfect collision from `thrust.c::insideblock()` using Canvas pixel data or bitmask arrays.

### 4. State Management
Use React for UI state (menus, HUD), but keep game physics in pure JavaScript for performance.

### 5. Gravity Sensor Control
Use DeviceOrientation/DeviceMotion API for tilt-based control:

**DeviceOrientation (rotation):**
- `event.alpha` - Z-axis rotation (0-360°)
- `event.beta` - X-axis rotation (-180 to 180°, front/back tilt)
- `event.gamma` - Y-axis rotation (-90 to 90°, left/right tilt)

**Mapping to Thrust:**
- `gamma` (left/right tilt) → Ship rotation
- `beta` (front/back tilt) → Thrust (forward tilt = thrust)
- Threshold values to prevent accidental inputs
- Calibration option for neutral position

**iOS 13+ Permission:**
```javascript
// Request permission for iOS 13+
if (typeof DeviceOrientationEvent.requestPermission === 'function') {
  DeviceOrientationEvent.requestPermission()
    .then(response => {
      if (response === 'granted') {
        window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', handleOrientation);
      }
    });
}
```

**Fallback:**
- If sensor not available → Default to virtual joystick
- User can select control type in settings menu

## Implementation Priority
Phases are ordered by dependency - each phase builds on the previous one.

## AI Vibecoding Optimization

### Incremental Deliverables
Each phase produces a working, testable component:

**Phase 1 Deliverable**: Flying ship in a level with gravity
**Phase 2 Deliverable**: Complete game objects with interactions
**Phase 3 Deliverable**: Visual polish matching original
**Phase 4 Deliverable**: Complete audio experience
**Phase 5 Deliverable**: Complete playable game
**Phase 6 Deliverable**: Web app ready for mobile browsers
**Phase 7 Deliverable**: Native iOS and Android projects configured
**Phase 8 Deliverable**: Production-ready native apps
**Phase 9 Deliverable**: Apps published to both stores

### Clear Dependencies
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (physics needed for game objects)
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (objects needed for rendering)
- Phase 4 is independent (can be done in parallel with Phase 2-3)
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 2-3 (game loop needs objects + rendering)
- Phase 6 depends on Phase 5 (mobile needs working game)
- Phase 7 depends on Phase 6 (Capacitor needs web app)
- Phase 8 depends on Phase 7 (polish needs native projects)
- Phase 9 depends on Phase 8 (deployment needs polished apps)

### Testable Milestones
After each phase, run tests and game to verify:
- Phase 1: Unit tests pass (physics, level parser, input), ship flies, gravity works
- Phase 2: Unit tests pass (game objects, bunkers, buttons, pod), bunkers shoot, buttons work, pod tows
- Phase 3: Unit tests pass (sprites, particles, effects), sprites render, effects play
- Phase 4: Unit tests pass (audio engine, sounds), sounds play correctly
- Phase 5: Unit tests pass (game loop, scoring, UI), full game loop works
- Phase 6: Unit tests pass (mobile features), E2E tests pass, touch/gravity controls work on mobile
- Phase 7: Unit tests pass (Capacitor), native apps build and run
- Phase 8: Unit tests pass (native features, performance), native apps polished
- Phase 9: Build tests pass, apps submitted to stores

## Advantages of This Approach
1. **Maximum Code Reuse**: ~70-80% of game logic can be ported directly
2. **Authentic Gameplay**: Physics and level design remain identical to original
3. **Modern Tech Stack**: React + Canvas for maintainability
4. **Asset Reuse**: Level files and sprite data can be converted
5. **Proven Logic**: dulsi/thrust is a mature, bug-free implementation
6. **Single Codebase**: Web, iOS, and Android from one codebase via Capacitor
7. **Native Performance**: Capacitor WebView provides near-native performance
8. **Easy Updates**: Web app updates automatically, native apps via store updates
9. **Cost Effective**: No need for separate native development teams

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance**: JavaScript physics may be slower than C → Optimize with typed arrays, reduce GC pressure
- **Audio**: Web Audio API complexity → Use simple wrapper library, handle mobile audio context restrictions
- **Mobile Touch Controls**: Virtual joystick implementation → Test extensively on real devices, add haptic feedback
- **Gravity Sensor Support**: DeviceOrientation API varies by device → Test on multiple devices, add fallback to touch controls
- **iOS Sensor Permission**: iOS 13+ requires user permission → Implement permission request flow, handle denial gracefully
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test across browsers, use polyfills if needed
- **iOS WebView Performance**: May be slower than Safari → Optimize rendering, use GPU acceleration
- **Android Fragmentation**: Different screen sizes/densities → Responsive design, test on multiple devices
- **App Store Approval**: Apple review process → Follow guidelines, avoid rejected patterns
- **Memory Constraints**: Mobile devices have limited RAM → Optimize sprite loading, use object pooling
- **Audio Context on Mobile**: Requires user interaction → Initialize audio on first touch/start button
- **Orientation Issues**: Mobile devices rotate → Lock to landscape, handle orientation changes gracefully
